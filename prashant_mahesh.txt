Relevant files 
--------
bin/console -- Runs a console with the classes loaded. For dev
lib/kabali.rb -- This has all the code for the implementation.
bin/kabali -- This has some test lines. You can switch different samples over here.
Gemfile -- Has all the dependencies to be installed.

Classes
=========
Kabali -- Has the list of blocks it contains and a stack data-structure. 
MyBlock -- Stores the title of the block, and the disassembled code belonging to the block. 

Methods
=========
Constructor (Initialize) -- Accepts a part of the code as input and disassembles it. It then extracts the blocks calling extract_blocks method.
extract_blocks -- This method traverses through the disasm code and removes the blocks from it, storing it in separate objects. 
traverse -- This method is public, and a user can call it to traverse through the disasm code line by line. This method calls the resolve and draw helpers repeatedly. 
resolve -- This method has a table mapping instructions to actions. We need to add more content to this method to make it work better.
draw -- This method clears the screen, accepts an enter key, and then displays the current location of the PC and the stack status. 

Screenshots
=========
Files attached show how the code iterates, and a sample of the display.
